## Project Background

### **Motivation**
- The global wine industry is valued at $109.5 billion USD.
- Differentiating wine quality often depends on subjective evaluations by sommeliers.

### **Goal**
- Bridge the gap between subjective judgment and objective, data-driven assessment.  
- Leverage machine learning to classify red wine quality based on chemical properties.

## Dataset Overview

### **Source**
- Red Wine Quality Dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

### **Details**
- **Observations:** 1,599 rows.
- **Features:** 11 chemical properties, e.g., acidity, alcohol, residual sugar.  
- **Target:** Quality score ranging from 0 (low) to 10 (high).

### **Key Insight**
- Quality scores are subjective and provided by three wine specialists, introducing potential variability in judgment.

## Data Retrieval

### **Data Cleaning**
- **Missing Values:** Verified none using `isnull()` and `info()` in Python.  
- **Duplicate Rows:** Detected and removed 240 duplicates.

### **Final Dataset**
- **Rows Reduced:** From 1,599 to 1,359 after cleaning.  
- Ensured a reliable and representative dataset for analysis.
